# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
this is a web based game named ultimate tic tac toe (HTML,CSS,JS,PHP,MySql) --
i just started learning web developing so this only runs on localhost and for running you need to have something like xampp that supports apache and mysql and php ...
after you did that you need to have an empty database.just create an empty database(easy-one line command) and enter your username and password in line 35 of db.php file.
($conn = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost; dbname=your_db_name", 'your_username', 'your-password'))
you can see game rules by clicking on help btn on game
and that it !!!
